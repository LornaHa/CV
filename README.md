I have worked in a variety of different roles and industries during my working career. I decided to go back into education to make a career which was more fitting with my passions and goals in life. 
Whilst studying within the sciences, I discovered the world of coding. The freedom and impacts which technology can have on the world and society has motivated me to develop my skills as a programmer.

Since October 2018 I have been studying on an intensive 16 week bootcamp course at [Makers](https://makers.tech/), where I have been learning the fundamentals of Software Development through project work.
Makers has taught me the importance of best coding practices, such as TDD, DRY, Pair Programming, XP values and Agile.

**Tech skills:** Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Python, MongoDB, Jasmine, Rspec, Express, Node, Sinatra, SQL, HTTP, OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD, HTML, CSS, Git, Github


## Skills

**Persistence and Determination**

My passion and determination in becoming a well rounded developer is shown in my persistence to learning. I have taken measures to learn by attending a variety of different courses, meeting other developers at tech events and meet-ups, and also by gaining hands on experience within a Back End team as an Intern Junior Software Developer.

**Teamwork**

I have experience of working within a variety of different teams over my 12 years working life. I can work effectively and confidently within a diverse team and across multiple teams within an organisation. 
I am able to participate in many different roles, showing leadership and direction as well as allowing others to be heard and lead in an equal and fair working environment. I believe that the most important aspect within a team is one based on equality and inclusion, which allows collaborative work without ego and allowing every individual to feel heard and empowered.

## Education

**Makers (1st October 2018 - 1st February 2019)**               
*16 week intensive software development bootcamp*       

Makers has allowed for personal development as well as learning the fundamentals of programming. Every day consisted of morning workshops and personal development, followed by afternoon pair programming projects. The intensity of the course regularly put me out of my comfort zone, forcing me to develop strategies which allowed fast and independent learning. I also developed an open mind to problem solving as well as being able to refine my skills of breaking down problems. This enables me to be able to take on any challenge, however big it may seem to begin with.

Working with others has been one of the main aspects of the course, I feel I am a great collaborator and I work at my best with others.

The fundamentals which I have learnt on this course are:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, JavaScript, Rails
- RSpec, Jasmine
- SQL, HTTP 
- Sinatra
- Git, Github
